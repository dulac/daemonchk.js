daemonchk.js - Daemon Monitoring/Checking tool
------------------------------------------------

SCREENSHOTS: http://joshdulac.com/index.php/check-daemons-with-daemonchk-js/

This tool will check a list of daemons (services) running on a server. The results are shown through a webpage user interface.

Green boxes show that the service is up and responding, while yellow boxes show that there was an error.

The name of the daemon will only be reported if there was an error.

The code can be fit into your server monitoring page with little effort.

daemonchk.js is released under the MIT license.
